# BookStore

This project is a course project during 2023-2024. This project integrated a number of diffent internet techs like gateway,
redis etc. to construct a complex system.

This project runs on localhost. It is not released, so if you want to try to run it, you should resolve all the **dependencies** besides **install jdk1.8 and sql**:<br>
1. run the nacos service
2. run MongoDB
3. run neo4j
4. run zookeeper and kafka
5. run redis(optional)<br>
<p>
after that open my_bookstore_backend and all the services in microservice, including the gateway. At last open the frontend and enjoy the fun of this project :)
